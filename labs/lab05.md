# Programming Lab 4 - Encrypted Chat Server/Client   

The intend of this exercise is to demonstrate symmetric encryption techniques. We will be using the simple client and server applications from Programming Lab 3, to pass back and forth single line encrypted text messages. Specifically, you will update the client and the server to use a single key to encrypt and decrypt a message.
