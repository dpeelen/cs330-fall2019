### My First Web Server 
- Update your server so that can recieve and parses HTTP requests - extracts the file path from the URL. Rememeber the URL is the second token in the request line.   
- If the file in the request exists - return _200 OK_ and the file contents as a HTTP response message.
- If file doesnâ€™t exist, send a properly formatted _404 Not Found_ error message.
- [WebServer](WebServer.java) - in case you couldn't finish the initial code at class.

### Extra Credit 
- Rewrite your server so that it can accept multiple connections (this allows the server to serve arbitrary number of clients). 
Hint: start a separate thread for every new client
- Append the thread name for each connection to the response headers.

### Hints
If you get stuck extracting the URL from the request line, [this](getfilename.txt) starting point may help.
